Rails Multistep Forms with Wizard
===

This is the accompanying Rails application to [my blog post on Multistep forms in Rails](http://brains.rabid.co.nz/2014/09/29/rails-multistep-forms.html). If you haven't already read that post, it is suggested that you read it to have the context of this application.

If you're just after having a play with this, there's a demo application hosted on Heroku, at: [https://jm-multistep-blog-demo.herokuapp.com](https://jm-multistep-blog-demo.herokuapp.com) to play with.

If you want to poke around the code, you can explore the project here on Github. Please open an issue if you have questions or trouble.

If you want to try and add to this example, or improve it in any way, you can clone the project and make your own changes:

1. Clone: `git clone git://github.com/joshmcarthur/rails-multistep-forms-demo`
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Set up database (SQLite3): `rake db:setup`
4. Start Rails server: `rails server`
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
